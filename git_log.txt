Date:   Sat Nov 16 16:12:26 2024 +0200

    Cleaned up the code, refactored the files for a consistent style, and added javadocs to functions. Still need to manage hashmaps and eventually create a dispatcher class.

    Repaired homework according to the points table: one class for each minion and hero. Thus, abilities and minions are no longer detached from one another. Still need to find a better way to construct hashmaps.

    Finished migrating to Maven. Updated code to avoid using Java reflection and deleted the previous IOHandler. Need to add documentation and make a few amends.

    Scrapped Commands enum and encapsulated each command in a function. Need to find a solution around using the gigantic switch statement that drives gameplay. Simplified IO handling by reducing repetitive calls to writing data.

    Started fixing Checkstyle errors (mostly making final fields private instead of public, and naming conventions). Added a Commands enum with lambda so that I can call functions for each inputAction more easily. Finished reflexive IOHandler wrapper over Jackson.

    Started refactoring IOHandler and implementing my own annotations. Can create JSON objects with reflexivity, very useful in making flattened structures in nested objects.

    Imported fixed tests. Implementation works and logic done, all tests pass. Card types are now more granular. Heavy refactoring is required in Game.java, as well as better encapsulation.

    First test passed -- implemented IOHandler, cards and minions, started parsing input for actions
